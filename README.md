# Blurry

Ever wanted to set a photo as your wallpaper but find out that the image does not fit as a wallpaper due to the amount of detail that blocks the screen? 

With Blurry, you can customize and apply a blur effect on top of any photos from your photo library to create the perfect wallpaper for your home screen or lock screen.

From a selection of dark blur, light blur, and custom colour blur, through a extraordinarily simple UI, you can tweak the image blur however you like and save it when you are satisfied. It's that simple!
